# AcousticSourceModeling
In line array systems, it is assumed that all sources are equal to guarantee a correct performance in the sound radiation of these, however, in practice this does not happen, since some components of the sources, which are characterized as Thiele Small parameters are rarely equal despite being of the same model, making the performance of a line array affected. The present project aimed to evaluate the effects of varying Thiele Small parameters in line arrays with and without a coupled transmission line. For this purpose, an analytical model of the acoustic source with a coupled transmission line waveguide based on Thiele Small parameters was developed and a methodology for the random variation of these parameters based on real statistics was implemented.
